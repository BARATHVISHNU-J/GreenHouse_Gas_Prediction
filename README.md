# Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction from Industrial Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industrial processes using machine learning techniques. Accurate prediction of GHG emissions is crucial for monitoring environmental impact, regulatory compliance, and developing strategies for emission reduction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of industrial process data collected from various sources. It includes features such as:
- Process parameters (temperature, pressure, flow rates, etc.)
- Raw material usage
- Energy consumption
- Emission measurements (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.)
- Time stamps and operational conditions

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and normalization to improve model performance.

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gathering industrial data, cleaning, and preparing it for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features that capture the underlying process dynamics.
3. **Model Selection:** Evaluating various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
4. **Model Training:** Training models on the processed dataset with hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
6. **Prediction & Analysis:** Using the best model to predict GHG emissions and analyze results.

## Model Details
- **Algorithms Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Neural Networks (e.g., Multi-layer Perceptron)
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid Search and Random Search techniques applied for optimal model parameters.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your industrial dataset in the required format (CSV or similar).
2. Update the configuration file or script parameters to point to your dataset.
3. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
6. Use the trained model to make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference between predicted and actual emissions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of the average squared differences.
- **R-squared (R²):** Proportion of variance explained by the model.

## Results
The best performing model achieved the following results on the test set:
- MAE: [Insert value]
- RMSE: [Insert value]
- R²: [Insert value]

Visualizations of predicted vs actual emissions and feature importance are included in the `results/` directory.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional data sources such as weather and production schedules.
- Explore advanced deep learning architectures like LSTM for time series prediction.
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time emission monitoring.
- Implement explainability techniques to interpret model predictions.
