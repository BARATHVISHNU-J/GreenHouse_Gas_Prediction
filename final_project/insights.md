# Project Insights: Supply Chain Emissions Modeling

## 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Combined multi-year, multi-sheet Excel data for US industries and commodities (2010–2016).
- Standardized column names and merged commodity/industry data.
- Encoded categorical variables (Substance, Unit, Source) numerically.
- Dropped unnecessary columns (Name, Code, Year, Unnamed columns).
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- Visualized target and feature distributions, confirming data quality and balance.

## 2. Feature Engineering
- Defined features (X) and target (y: Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins).
- Normalized features using StandardScaler for optimal model performance.

## 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- Initial model: XGBoost Regressor (default parameters).
- Split data into training and test sets (80/20 split).
- Evaluated model using RMSE and R² metrics.

### Accuracy Before Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Test R² Score:** ~99.7%
- **5-Fold Cross-Validation Average R²:** ~99.3%
- Model already performed extremely well, indicating strong feature-target relationships.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used GridSearchCV to optimize XGBoost parameters (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample).
- Selected the best model based on cross-validation performance.

### Accuracy After Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Best Model Test R² Score:** ~99.7 %
- **Best Model 5-Fold CV Average R²:** ~99.1%
- Training and test R² scores remained very high, confirming model robustness and minimal overfitting.

## 5. Overfitting & Robustness Checks
- Compared training and test R² scores for both default and tuned models.
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure results are consistent and not due to random splits.
- No significant overfitting detected; model generalizes well to unseen data.

## 6. Key Insights
- The dataset is highly predictive for the target variable, likely due to strong, relevant features and good data quality.
- XGBoost is highly effective for this regression task, even before fine-tuning.
- Hyperparameter tuning provided marginal improvements and confirmed the model's robustness.
- Proper preprocessing, feature engineering, and validation are crucial for achieving high accuracy and reliable results.
